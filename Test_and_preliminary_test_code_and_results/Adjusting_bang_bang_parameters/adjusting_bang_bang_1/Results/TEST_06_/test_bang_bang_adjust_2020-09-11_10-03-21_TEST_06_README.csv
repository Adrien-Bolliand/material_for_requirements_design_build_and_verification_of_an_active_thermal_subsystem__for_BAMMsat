"IMPORTANT. Values of the data file are valide from their ""time log"" of the same line until the ""time log"" of the next line"
Voltage power supply: 24 V
"Note from end of experiment: START: 0sec(pi in PV) for  24sec(pi in vacuum). Into freezer at ~ 400 sec. RTD_1_2 seems to have failed. At 12 050 sec, spayed water that froze on the feedtrhoughs. At 14 270 sec, sprayed again"
"Values on the bottom where logged at the end of the experiment . START: 0sec(pi in PV) for  24sec(pi in vacuum). Into freezer at ~ 400 sec. RTD_1_2 seems to have failed. At 12 050 sec, spayed water that froze on the feedtrhoughs. At 14 270 sec, sprayed again"

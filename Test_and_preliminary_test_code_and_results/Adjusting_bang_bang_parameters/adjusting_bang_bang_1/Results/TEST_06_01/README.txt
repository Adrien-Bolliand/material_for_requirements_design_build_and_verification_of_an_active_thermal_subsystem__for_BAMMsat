TEST_06_1
bang bang parameters
disc:  0 10 80 100 % // 19 19.5 20 20.5 °C
fluid: 0 90 90 100 % // 10 12   13 14   °C

Same configuration that TEST_06 BUT:
Placed the vacuum chamber and the vessel inside the -50 °C freezer with the vacuum pump not working and the heater disconnected.
The goal is to have a cold system to start with.
After 1h30min (the time of a BEXUS ascent), the vacuum will be made, and the heaters turned ON.

Time difference between the timing of the pressure_vessel_pi/vacuum_pi: 0/37 sec
